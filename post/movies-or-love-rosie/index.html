            <p>You deserve someone who loves you with every beat of his heart.<br>
Someone who will always be there for you, and who will love every part of you,especially your flaws.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787385834.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Tell them that this is,<br>
that this has to be...<br>
Everybody!<br>
.….one of the happiest days of my life...<br>
Please!<br>
For those l haven't had the chance to say hi to properly,l'm Rosie.<br>
And this has got to be<br>
one of the happiest days of my life.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787390329.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
l think not telling you was a way to keep the dream alive, you know ?<br>
So there was at least someone out there<br>
who still saw me as Rosie.<br>
And not this strange, new person l've become.<br>
So, the last time l looked that depressed, l tried to hang myself with my favorite tie.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787393937.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Choosing the person that you want to share your life with is one of the most important decisions any of us makes, ever.<br>
Because when it' s wrong, it turns your life to grey.<br>
And sometimes...<br>
Sometimes you don' t even notice until you wake up one morning and realize years hve gone by.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787399317.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Take a deep breath and start at the beginning.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787403651.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
You will live a long and happy life. Sweet.<br>
Oh, can I switch?<br>
Cause you prefer mine?<br>
I prefer it.<br>
l do, I do. I don't know what I'm talking about.<br>
Well, you do go here, so you probably should know what you're talking about.<br>
Strange to think that I could have lived here and been part of it.<br>
But I don't regret Katie, you know?<br>
l mean, how could I? She's the most amazing kid.<br>
The weird thing is that she reminds me more of you than Greg.<br>
That' s probably just 'cause I love her.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787407979.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Be reckless. Live for the moment.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787413075.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
There' s not much I got right in my life,<br>
but this family,<br>
somehow we' re making it work.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787422553.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
There' s nothing you can' t do if you put your mind to it.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787427741.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Dear Rosie, I can't believe it.<br>
Here I am at last, finally walking the Mediterranean coast.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787431929.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
I've lost count of the years I've waited for this moment.<br>
Somehow life got in the way.<br>
And it was all good,<br>
I don't regret a minute of it,<br>
but we forget our dreams at our peril.<br>
I know you had yours, too,<br>
and it must feel sometimes like they're gone for good.<br>
But I'm so proud of the woman you've become, Rosie,<br>
of the mother you've been to Katie.<br>
What I once said about you is still true,<br>
there's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it.<br>
So keep chasing those dreams,<br>
will you, darling?<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787437380.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
I was a fucked-up kid all over again.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787443807.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Your friendship has brought glorious Technicolor to my life.<br>
It's been there even in the darkest of times.<br>
And I am the luckiest person alive for that gift.<br>
I hope I didn't take it for granted.<br>
I think maybe I did.<br>
Because sometimes you don't see that the best thing that's ever happened to you is sitting there, right under your nose.<br>
But that's fine, too.<br>
It really is.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787450690.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Because I've realized that<br>
no matter where you are<br>
or what you're doing or who you're with,<br>
I will always<br>
honestly, truly,<br>
completely love you.<br>
Like a sister loves a brother<br>
and a friend loves a friend.<br>
Ill always stand guard over your dreams, Alex.<br>
No matter how weird or twisted they get.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787457814.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
I was me.<br>
And you were you,<br>
standing where you are right now, perfect.<br>
And I took you in my arms, in a manly kind of way.<br>
Like this.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636787462334.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
And said,<br>
&quot;Rosie Dunne, can I take you to the dance?&quot;<br>
Better late than never.</p>
