            <p>&quot;Is better to speak or to die?&quot;<br>
There's no one else I can say this to but you</p>
<p>Summer 1983<br>

My mom has been reading this 16th-certury French romance. She read some of it to my dad and I the night the lights went out.<br>
About the knight that doesn't know whether to speak or die?<br>
Right.<br>
So, does he doesn't he?<br>
&quot;Better to speak&quot; she said.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636786741275.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
You two had a nice friendship.<br>
Yeah.<br>
You're too smart not to know how rare, how special what you two had was.<br>
Oliver was Oliver.<br>
Because it was him. Because it was me.<br>
Oliver may be very intelligent but…<br>
Oh, no, no. He was more than intelligent. What you two had… had everything and nothing to do with intelligence. He was good. You were both lucky to have found each other, because… you, too, are good.<br>

Which flatters you both. You know, when you least expect it, nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just remember, I'm here. Right now, you may not want to feel anything. And maybe it's not me you want to speak about these things, but uh… feel something, you obviously did. Look, you had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you.<br>

In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, and pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing, so as not to feel anything. What a waste!<br>

How you live your life is your business. Just remember… Our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. Most of us can't help but live as though we've got two lives to live, one is the mockup, the other the finished version, and then there are all those versions in between. But there's only one, and before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there's sorrow, pain. Don't kill it… and with it, the joy you felt.<br>

Twenty years was yesterday, and yesterday was just earlier this morning, and morning seemed light-years away.<br>
