            <p>I guess it comes down to a simple choice:get busy living or get busy dying.<br>

Fear can hold you prisoner,hope can set you free.<br>

A strong man can save himself,a great man can save others.<br>

I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about. Truth is, I don’t want to know. Some things are better left unsaid.I’d like to think they were singing about somethings so beautiful,it can&quot; t expressed in words,and it makes your heart ache because of it.I tell you, th ose voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a great place dares to dr eam. It was as if some beautiful bird had flapped into our drab little cage an d made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man is Shawshank felt free.<br>

I have to remind myself that some birds don' t mean to be caged . Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up. DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they’re gone. I guess I just miss my friend.<br>

These walls are funny.First you hate them,then you get used to them;Enough time passes,gets so you depend on them.That's institutionalized.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636788198246.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
There' s not a day goes by I don' t feel regret. Not because I' m in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then. Then a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can' t. That kid' s long gone and this old man is all that' s left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It' s just a bull.......... word. So you go on and stamp your form, sorry, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don' t give a shit.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636788210231.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
The most important things are hardest to tell,because words shrink their importance.It's not easy to let strangers care about the good things in your life.<br>
<img src="https://wangfengyi0228.github.io/post-images/1636788214822.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Every one is their God,if you give up on yourself,who else will save you?Every one is busy,some are busy livig,some are busy dying,and you, who are busy chasing fame and fortune,who are busy with daily necessities,try to stop to think a second:if your brain has been institutionalized?Where is your God?<br>

Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things,and no good thing ever dies.<br>

I find I' m so excited. I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.<br>

These are something inside,that they can't get to ,that they can't touch,That's yours.<br>

What upset you will be talked about by you with smile one day.<br>
